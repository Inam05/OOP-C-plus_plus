/*
Create a base class called Geometry with virtual functions
calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Derive subclasses Circle, Rectangle,
and Triangle from Geometry. Implement the calculateArea() and
calculatePerimeter() functions differently in each subclass to calculate the area
and perimeter of the respective shapes.
